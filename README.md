# Predictive Modeling in Baseball: A Logistic Regression Analysis
  
This repository contains my bachelor's thesis project, aimed at quantifying the role of chance in a *Major League Baseball* season through repeated simulations using Logistic Regression.

## Project Recap

The *step by step* structure of the analysis was the following:

1) Creation of the dataset through feature extraction and construction
2) Descriptive analysis and univariate modeling
3) Model selection (through stepwise AIC and AUROC) and diagnostics
4) Simulation of 1000 *MLB* seasons by predicting the win probability of each game with the above selected model

## Repository Contents

- My full graduation thesis (written in Italian) is available as a pdf in the *`thesis`* folder. It contains a detailed description of every step of the project, including information on the methods that were used, the thoughts behind the choices that were made and a list of the bibliographical resources. The analysis is also quickly syinthetized in English in the *`README`* file within the same folder.

- The original datasets used for the analysis are contained in the *`data`* folder. These were downloaded from *Retrosheet*, *Fangraphs* and the *Lahman Database*.
