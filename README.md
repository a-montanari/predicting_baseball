# Predictive Modeling in Baseball: A Logistic Regression Analysis
  
This repository contains my bachelor's thesis project, aimed at quantifying the role of chance in a *Major League Baseball* season through repeated simulations, using an appositely selected Logistic Regression model.  

## Steps of the Project

1) Creation of the final dataset through feature extraction and construction, starting from public resources
2) Descriptive analysis and univariate modeling
3) Model selection (through stepwise AIC and AUROC) and diagnostics
4) Simulation of 1000 *MLB* regular and post seasons by predicting the win probability of each game and assuming it as the unknown parameter *p* in an independent Bernoulli trial

You can find more information by reading the full report available in the *Thesis* folder (only in Italian, at the moment).  

## Repository Contents

- *`Thesis`*: the final pdf report (written in Italian)

- *`Data`*: the original datasets used for the analysis

- *`Code`*: the R scripts containing the code I wrote for the project
